## About
Welcome to the UNO Card Game !                                        
This project is a Python-based implementation of the popular card game UNO. The game is designed to be played by 2 players, with the goal of being the first to get rid of all your cards. The game follows the traditional UNO rules, with a deck consisting of four suits (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) and special action cards that add strategic elements to the gameplay. 
## Features
- Support for 2 players.
- Automatic shuffling and dealing of cards.
- Implementation of special action cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, and Wild Draw Four).
- User-friendly GUI.
- Both players can see each other's decks, making the game more tactical rather than purely luck-based.
- Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for better code organization and maintenance.
## How to Play
1. At the start of the game, each player is dealt 7 cards.
2. The top card of the deck is flipped over to start the discard pile.
3. Players take turns matching a card from their hand to the top card of the discard pile by either color or number.
4. Special action cards can change the direction of play, skip players, force opponents to draw cards, or change the current color.
5. The first player to play all of their cards wins the game.
